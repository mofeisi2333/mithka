# Builds TDLib's `tdjson` for iOS (device arm64 + simulator) and installs it as
# a static library that links into the Runner app, so the Dart FFI layer can
# resolve the symbols via DynamicLibrary.process() at runtime.
#
# The simplest, most reliable route is the official prebuilt XCFramework from
# tdlib/td-ios or building from source per https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html.
# This script wires a prebuilt `tdjson.xcframework` (placed at
# ios/tdjson/tdjson.xcframework) into the Runner target via the generated
# Xcode project; if you build from source, drop the resulting xcframework there.
#
# After placing the xcframework, also ensure ios/Podfile links it (see NATIVE.md)
# and that "Embed & Sign" is set so the symbols are present in the process.
